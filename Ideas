# Here are some ideas for improvement and new features:
#
# Simplify by using components already present on the system: possibly alias and commandline completion.
#
# Better documentation.
#
# Automatically backup the speed list to keep it persistent.
#
# Harden the scripting, replace the sourcing, detect problem input, so that its a lower security risk.
#
# Create a FIFO style queque (like an email queue) that lists files of interest to either view or edit later.
#
# Add support for multiple speed lists, making it possible to have themes.
#
# add more functions to apply to the current file 
#
# Interactive configuration scripts, so that most configuration does not need to be done in files.
#
# Configurations for more editors or word processors and support for more kinds of media and tasks: arbitrary tasks.
#
# Integration with Chroot jails or systemd jails, so if they are needed they start right up.
#
# Create a hook for common gui systems to select files of interest and add them to the list or display it.
#
# Create support for emacs integration
#
# Function for vim to add a file to a speedlist or to a fifo queue.
#
# Make it work across networks, sockets and other bus types.
#
# Better Wordgrinder support
